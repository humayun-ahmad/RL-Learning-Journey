# RL Learning Journey 🚀  

Welcome to my **Reinforcement Learning (RL) Journey**! This repository documents everything I learn about RL, including theory, projects, implementations, and resources.  

## 🌟 Why This Repository?  
I created this repo to:  
✅ Keep track of my RL learning progress.  
✅ Work on hands-on projects to strengthen my understanding.  
✅ Share useful notes and resources.  
✅ Implement RL algorithms from scratch and experiment with them.  

## 📌 Learning Roadmap  
1. **Introduction to RL** – Basics, Markov Decision Process (MDP), Reward, Policy.  
2. **Value-Based Methods** – Q-learning, Deep Q-Network (DQN).  
3. **Policy-Based Methods** – REINFORCE, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).  
4. **Model-Free vs Model-Based RL** – Understanding the difference.  
5. **Advanced Topics** – Actor-Critic, AlphaGo, MuZero, Multi-Agent RL.  
6. **Practical Implementations** – Applying RL to OpenAI Gym, Robotics, and Games.
